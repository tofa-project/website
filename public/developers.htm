            Before understanding how Tofa works, developers must know how Tor works:
            <a href="https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/documentation" target="_blank">https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/documentation</a>
            <br>
            <br>
            Suppose there is an online web app named <b>Foo</b>, and a client of that web app named <b>Bar</b>.
            On Tofa, each client is an onion service. That is, Bar has an onion service hosted on its own personal machine
            dedicated for Foo app. When Foo wants to perform a 2FA based action, it contacts Bar's hidden service via Tor 
            network with a custom token and waits for response. Based on response it executes the action.
            Due to the nature of onion services, neither Foo nor Bar know their IP addresses, and there is no 
            third party involved in the exchange. This type of communication ensures the privacy of both parties amid 
            synchronized authentication.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b id="auth_flow"><i>The flow of authentication is this:</i></b>
            <br>
            1) Before everything, Bar opens its Tofa Client, which can be downloaded <a href="downloads.htm">here</a>, 
            and creates a new app.
            <br>
            2) Then Bar registers its Foo account with the app it created on its Tofa Client.
            <br>
            3) After registration is successful, Foo can contact Bar amid 2FA related activities. 
            The human will see a notification/Yes&No modal in Tofa Client when so, having the opportunity to act accordingly. 
            Simple as that.
